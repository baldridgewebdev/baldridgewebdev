- 👋 Hi, I’m @baldridgewebdev
- 👀 I’m interested in web development and video game development. I have a background in C++, Java, PHP, and JavaScript, and I have messed around in a variety of other languages though.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning to use Godot 4, and am interesting in picking up Go.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything web or video game related, but am currently focused on obtaining my next full time position.
- 📬 You can reach me through [my website](https://baldridgeweb.dev/).
